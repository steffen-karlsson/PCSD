\subsection*{Question 2: Optimistic Concurrency Control}
\subsubsection*{Scenario 1}
\texttt{T3} is not allowed to commit because of validation test 2, regarding $T_i$ completes before $T_j$ begins its write phase, which is validated by checking that the intersection between the write set of $T_i$ and the read set of $T_j$ is equal to the empty set (Ø). In other words is the intersection in this case between write set of \texttt{T2} and read set of \texttt{T3} not empty.
\newline

The conflicting element in the intersection is: 4.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 2}
\texttt{T3} is again not allowed to commit due to same reason as above, just between \texttt{T1} and \texttt{T3} instead of \texttt{T2}.
\newline

The conflicting element in the intersection is: 3.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 3}
\texttt{T3} is allowed to commit because of two times validation test 2, as described in \textbf{Scenario 2}: \texttt{WS}(T1) $\cap$ \texttt{RS}(T3) = Ø and \texttt{WS}(T2) $\cap$ \texttt{RS}(T3) = Ø. Therefore does this scenario holds.
