\section*{Questions for Discussion on Architecture}
\subsection*{Question 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] Its strongly modular because the server-side and the client packages are independent, their common logic is separated from the two main modules.
	\item[b.] Taking a look at the two different client interfaces, namely \texttt{StockManager} and \texttt{BookStore} one might conclude that following - in a real life case - could be using the first interface \texttt{StockManager} for internal usages in the book company. Whereas the \texttt{BookStore} then most likely will be used for outside clients who wish to either rate or buy a book etc.
	\newline
	
	The reason for separating such interface instead of one including all, is that you want to separate "business" logic from clients and for safety/privacy reasons - i.e. an costumer i following setup isn't able to modify state of a book.
	\item[c.] Running the clients and services locally in the same JVM, forces the program to use the \texttt{CertainBookStore}, which both is a \texttt{StockManager} and a \texttt{BookStore} and therefor contains the functionality of all different interactions with the server. In this situation is the client and the server sharing the address space.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] The naming service is available throughout the \texttt{BookStoreHTTPMessageHandler}, which parses the requested api-call, extracts the name (one of following available in: \texttt{BookStoreMessageTag}) and executes the requested code.
	\item[b.] The naming service the client is using to communicate with the server is in this case the operating system, since the host is hard-coded to localhost on a specific port. Localhost is then mapped to the ip-address 127.0.0.1, which HTTP uses for communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 3}
All communication from client to server is implemented using the \texttt{SendAndRecv} method from the \texttt{BookStoreUtility}, this function secures an \textit{at-most-once} RPC semantic. The function doesn't try to resend if any failure and therefore it is not a \textit{at-least-once} semantic. In addition we doesn't have any tags on our requests and therefore can't secure that a request is send \textit{exactly-once}.

\subsection*{Question 4}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.]  Since non of our \texttt{GET} requests have any side-effects, it is secure to use web proxies for this kind of architecture.
	\item[b.] 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] 
	\item[b.]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 6}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] 
	\item[b.]
